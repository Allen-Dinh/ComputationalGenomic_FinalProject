Original genotype data can be found and downloaded from https://wfitch.bio.uci.edu/~dspr/Data/index.html. 
The file name is "HMM Results for pB RILs (at regularly spaced 10 kb intervals) (2GB)" under Genomic Data for Founders and RILs. 
After downloading, subsetting columns will result in the same format as in subset_genotype file. The columns to be subsetted are chr, pos, ID, and the last 8 columns.
